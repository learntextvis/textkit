sphinx-deployment
=================

Automatic setup and deployment for [sphinx][] docs.

This project is intended to be used to deploy [sphinx][] project on:

- [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles)
- [Rsync](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync)
- PaaS services: [heroku](http://heroku.com/), etc.

Usage
-----

**1. `$ make generate`**

For generating contents, alias for `$ make html`

**2. `$ make deploy`**

For short-cut deployment, it could be `$ make deploy_gh_pages`, `$ make deploy_rsync` or
`$ make deploy_heroku` basing on the configuration of `DEPLOY_DEFAULT`.

**3. `$ make gen_deploy`**

For short-cut generation and deployment: `$ make generate` and then `$ make deploy`.

**4. `$ make setup_gh_pages`**

For the first time only to create `$(DEPLOY_DIR)` to track `$(DEPLOY_BRANCH)`. This is used for
github pages deployment.

**5. `$ make setup_heroku`**

For the first time only to create `$(DEPLOY_DIR_HEROKU` to track the Heroku repo's master branch.
This is used for heroku deployment.

**6. `$ make deploy_gh_pages`**

For deploying with github pages only.

**7. `$ make deploy_rsync`**

For deploying with rsync only.

**8. `$ make deploy_heroku`**

For deploying with heroku only.


Installation
------------

**1. Bash script**

Just run this bash script from your root git repository project and it's enough.

You need to specify the `<docs_path>` to your sphinx docs directory:

``` bash
$ cd <your_project>
$ wget https://raw.github.com/teracyhq/sphinx-deployment/master/scripts/spxd.sh && chmod +x ./spxd.sh && ./spxd.sh -p <docs_path>
```

For example:

``` bash
$ cd my_project
$ wget https://raw.github.com/teracyhq/sphinx-deployment/master/scripts/spxd.sh && chmod +x ./spxd.sh && ./spxd.sh -p ./docs
```

**2. Manual**

a. You need to copy these following files to your [sphinx][] directory:

- `docs/requirements`
- `docs/sphinx_deployment.mk`
- `docs/rsync_exclude`
- `docs/.deploy_heroku/*`
- `docs/.gitignore`

b. Include `sphinx_deployment.mk` to your `Makefile`:

- Add the content below to your `Makefile`:

```
include sphinx_deployment.mk
```

- Or do with commands on terminal:

``` bash
echo '' >> Makefile
echo 'include sphinx_deployment.mk' >> Makefile
```


c.. To build with `travis-ci`, you need to copy these following files to your root project directory:

- `.travis.yml`
- `.travis/setup.sh`


Configuration
-------------

You need to configure these following deployment configurations following your project settings on
`sphinx_deployment.mk` file.

``` Makefile
# Deployment configurations from sphinx_deployment project

# default deployment when $ make deploy
# deploy_gh_pages                            : to $ make deploy_gh_pages
# deploy_rsync                               : to $ make deploy_rsync
# deploy_heroku                              : to $ make deploy_heroku
# deploy_gh_pages deploy_rsync deploy_heroku : to $ make deploy_gh_pages then $ make deploy_rsync
#                                              and then $ make deploy_heroku
# default value: deploy_gh_pages
ifndef DEPLOY_DEFAULT
DEPLOY_DEFAULT = deploy_gh_pages
endif

# The deployment directory to be deployed
ifndef DEPLOY_DIR
DEPLOY_DIR      = _deploy
endif

# The heroku deployment directory to be deployed
# we must create this separated dir to avoid any conflict with _deploy (rsync and gh_pages)
ifndef DEPLOY_DIR_HEROKU
DEPLOY_DIR_HEROKU = _deploy_heroku
endif

# Copy contents from $(BUILDDIR) to $(DEPLOY_DIR)/$(DEPLOY_HTML_DIR) directory
ifndef DEPLOY_HTML_DIR
DEPLOY_HTML_DIR = docs
endif


## -- Rsync Deploy config -- ##
# Be sure your public key is listed in your server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file
ifndef SSH_USER
SSH_USER       = user@domain.com
endif

ifndef SSH_PORT
SSH_PORT       = 22
endif

ifndef DOCUMENT_ROOT
DOCUMENT_ROOT  = ~/website.com/
endif

#If you choose to delete on sync, rsync will create a 1:1 match
ifndef RSYNC_DELETE
RSYNC_DELETE   = false
endif

# Any extra arguments to pass to rsync
ifndef RSYNC_ARGS
RSYNC_ARGS     =
endif

## -- Github Pages Deploy config -- ##

# Configure the right deployment branch
ifndef DEPLOY_BRANCH_GITHUB
DEPLOY_BRANCH_GITHUB = gh-pages
endif

#if REPO_URL_GITHUB was NOT defined by travis-ci
ifndef REPO_URL_GITHUB
# Configure your right github project repo
# REPO_URL       = git@github.com:teracy-official/sphinx-deployment.git
endif

## -- Heroku Deployment Config -- ##

ifndef REPO_URL_HEROKU
# Configure your right heroku repo
# REPO_URL_HEROKU = git@heroku.com:spxd.git
endif


## end deployment configuration, don't edit anything below this line ##

Continuous Integration Build
----------------------------

**1. `travis-ci`**

Move `.travis.yml` file to your root repository project, and configure it following its
instruction there. There is a supported `.travis/setup.sh` to export variables for `Makefile`
depending on the being-built branch.

To configure secure token for `travis-ci`, please read the similar step described at
http://blog.teracy.com/2013/08/03/how-to-start-blogging-easily-with-octopress-and-teracy-dev/


**2. `jenkins`**
